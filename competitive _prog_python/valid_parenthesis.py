# 1Start
# 2Create an empty stack.
# 3 Read the input string.
# 4Initialize a variable i to 0 to keep track of the current character index.
# 5 Repeat steps 6-12 while i is less than the length of the input string.
# 6 Get the character at index i from the input string.
# Check if the character is an opening bracket ('(', '{', or '[').
# If it is an opening bracket, push it onto the stack.
# If it is a closing bracket (')', '}', or ']'), check if the stack is empty.
# If the stack is empty, or the top of the stack does not match the current closing bracket, go to the "Invalid" branch.
# If the above condition is not met, pop the top element from the stack.
# Increment i by 1.
# Check if i is equal to the length of the input string.
# If i is equal to the length of the input string, go to the "Check Stack" branch.
# If i is not equal to the length of the input string, go back to step 6.
# Check if the stack is empty.
# If the stack is empty, go to the "Valid" branch.
# If the stack is not empty, go to the "Invalid" branch.
# Output "Valid".
# Stop.
# Output "Invalid".
# Stop.
# Note: Steps 13, 14, and 15 are used to iterate through each character in the input string, and steps 16-18 are used to check the final state of the stack.

# I hope this description helps you in creating a flowchart for the algorithm.
